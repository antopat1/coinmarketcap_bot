# Coinmarketcap_bot report

Every day, at a specific time, we want to obtain as much information as possible about cryptocurrencies, process it, and store the results in a JSON file.

## Requirements:

● The cryptocurrency with the highest trading volume (in $) in the last 24 hours.

● The top 10 best and worst performing cryptocurrencies (by percentage increase) in the last 24 hours.

● The amount of money required to buy one unit of each of the top 20 cryptocurrencies.

● The amount of money required to buy one unit of all cryptocurrencies with a trading volume higher than $76,000,000 in the last 24 hours.

● The percentage gain or loss you would have made if you had bought one unit of each of the top 20 cryptocurrencies* the day before (assuming the rankings have not changed).
